# Pick and Place Robot Arm

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a Pick and Place Robot Arm for the precise assembly of electronic components such as rivets, washers, and transistors onto cylindrical heat sinks for a 3-phase H-bridge system. The system incorporates horizontal and vertical conveyor systems, a customized gripper mechanism, and a user-friendly controller interface.
